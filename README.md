# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions (Golang)

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges implemented in Golang. Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming puzzles throughout December.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an event created by Eric Wastl where participants solve programming puzzles of increasing difficulty each day leading up to Christmas.

## Solutions Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Each day's challenge has its own folder named according to the day (e.g., `day01`, `day02`, etc.). Within each folder, you'll find the solutions implemented in Golang.

The solutions are structured with detailed comments explaining the approach, algorithm used, and any notable optimizations or considerations.

## Folder Structure

- day01/
    - solution1.go
    - solution2.go
    - ...
- day02/
    - solution1.go
    - solution2.go
    - ...
- ...

## Running the Code

Each solution is self-contained and can be run independently. Refer to the specific README or comments within each solution file for instructions on how to execute the Golang code.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute additional solutions, improvements, or optimizations to existing Golang solutions, feel free to open a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express my gratitude to the creators of Advent of Code, Eric Wastl, and the entire community for making this event possible.
